1. Code structure:

Majority of the program is in logical_expression.py, including new functions to parse and evaluate all logical_expression type objects.
There is a few changes made to check_true_false.py but mostly for debug printing

2. Compilation instruction:

Since the program written in Python, no compilation is needed.
Use the following command to execute, depend on system it maybe python (Linux users/Omega) or python2 (MacOS users)

python check_true_false.py <wumpus rules file> <additional knowledge file> <statement file>

3. Omega specification:

Program is tested on Omega, depending on complexity of the statement the program can run up to 2 minutes.
For single symbol evaluation the program should be almost instantaneous.
