# Arduino Based Remote Control

An (awful) attempt to work with hardware trying to make a remote control for future projects.
If you use this project's code and your stuff went up in flames, that ain't my fault.
With the liability out of the way, here's the details. This project was made in PlatformIO
extension of VSCode, so for best compatibility and library access, use PlatformIO.
