# Arduino Based Remote Control

An (awful) attempt to work with hardware trying to make a remote control for future projects.
If you use this project's code and your stuff went up in flames, that ain't my fault.
With the liability out of the way, here's the details.

## Functionalities

- [x] Joystick control
- [ ] Joystick trigger ( debouce bug still exists )
- [x] LCD display ( 20 by 4 )
- [ ] OLED display ( 128px by 32px )
- [ ] accelerometer
